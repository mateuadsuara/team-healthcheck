add metrics
* for each:
  * name
  * criteria

register point-of-view
* person giving the point-of-view
* date
* health point-of-view(:shrug: | good/green..mediocre/yellow..bad/red encoded as 1..0..-1)
  - what do you think makes it the way it is (root cause)? :shrug: | reason
* slope point-of-view(:shrug: | bettering/climbing..unchanging/flat..worsening/falling encoded as 1..0..-1)
  - if bettering, what do you think made it better? :shrug: | reason
  - if unchanging, why do you think is it not changing? :shrug: | reason
  - if worsening, what do you think made it worse? :shrug: | reason

- want to give two answers?, then add metrics to represent the criteria for the two answers related to the previous metrics and disable outdated ones
- hidden until everyone registered to not influence others

review points-of-view
- if points-of-view are too different
  - misunderstood criteria?, then add metrics with refined criteria consensus related to the previous metrics and disable outdated ones
  - different perspectives on the same criteria?, they are all valid points of view!, maybe register again to add details

see evolution of metrics

METRIC OPERATIONS TO IMPLEMENT:

* add (name, criteria, maybe-refined-metrics)
* disable
* re-enable
* register (point-of-view, date, health, slope, maybe-health-reason, maybe-slope-reason)

MAYBE IN THE FUTURE:

team consensus about situation
* root cause of the problem
* plan of improvement(None | keep doing what you're doing | do something else)

register many teams and compare with other teams
